###### Mequitta Ahuja, *Le Damn Revisited*, 2018. [Courtesy of the artist.](http://www.mequittaahuja.com/digital-portfolio.html) 

###### In *Le Damn Revisted*, the artist sits in front of a depiction of one of her earlier works, *Le Damn*, an interpretation of Picasso's *Les Demoiselles D'Avignon.* *Le Damn Revisted* is an iteration on *Xpect*, a similar composition in which the the artist sits before *Le Damn* and holds a sonogram; Ahuja used *Xpect* to announce her pregnancy in 2018. Combining the historical context of art history with the contemporary landscape of social media, *Le Damn Revisited* introduces many of the same themes explored by this data analysis project: meaning created through careful patterns, repetition as a core faucet of process, the treatment of historical works with current technology, and the importance of critiquing Picasso.
