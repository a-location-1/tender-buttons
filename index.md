###### Mequitta Ahuja, *Le Damn Revisited*, 2018. [Courtesy of the artist.](http://www.mequittaahuja.com/digital-portfolio.html) The canvas in the background is the artist's earlier work, *Le Damn*, an interpretation of Picasso's *Les Demoiselles D'Avignon.* *Le Damn Revisted* is preceded by *Xpect*, a similar composition in which the the artist sits before *Le Damn* and holds a sonogram; Ahuja used *Xpect* to announce her pregnancy in 2018. *Le Damn Revisted* is a further iteration on *Xpect*. Combining historical context - art history - and the contemporary media landscape - social media - *Le Damn Revisited* reflects on many of the same themes as this data analysis project: meaning created through careful patterns, repetition, the treatment of historical works with current technology, and critiquing Picasso.
