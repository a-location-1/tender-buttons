## The Basics

> All this and not ordinary, not unordered in not resembling. The difference is spreading.

In this project I'm taking the text of Gertrude Stein's *Tender Buttons* and transforming it into a form amenable to data analysis. There are many ways to do this; for this first iteration of the project, I'm starting simple. 

## 1. Text Import: Reading from a .txt

##### 

The University of California libraries uploaded *Tender Buttons* to archive.org in 2007, and archive.org generates the "full text" using [some kind of optical character recognition (OCR)](https://blog.archive.org/2016/10/26/searching-through-everything/). I took [that text](https://archive.org/stream/tenderbuttonsobj00steirich/tenderbuttonsobj00steirich_djvu.txt) and copy-pasted it into local .txt files. It's not a perfect process: for example, page nine of the physical book is embossed with "UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA", which is transcribed in the text file as this enigmatic string of characters:

```
;  y  â€¢'  ; ;  >
```

Which I manually deleted. That's the kind of text cleaning the program is supposed to do - on to step two.  

```
HERE'S THE CODE FOR OPENING THE FILES. 
```

## 2. Text Cleaning

My solution to (1) cleaning up the text and (2) isolating the words is to read the entire text file letter by letter, twice. The first pass strips out page numbers and extra spaces, the second pass builds the subsection names (which always have the same format: all capital letters followed by a period, e.x. `A CARAFE, THAT IS A BLIND GLASS.`) and the words, storing the punctuation seperately.

The code tries to handle hyphens that result from line breaks, but my brute force solution isn't perfect. It also handles apostrophes (added to the word) and end punctuation (stored in a seperate variable). 

## 3. Text Export: Making a Relational database 

## 4. Data Analysis

## 5. Data Visualization

## Iteration Two?

For iteration two my aim is to make my code a bit more pythonic, although I'm going to hold off on exploring some of more powerful python libraries for now. 

| Stage      | Iteration One | Iteration Two | Iteration Three |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | 
| *Text Import*      | **Python.** Import from .txt.  | **Python.** Import text from a url. | TBD |
| *Text Cleaning*   | **Python.** Manual cleaning.  | **Python.** Use objects to allow for more extensible text cleaning. | TBD |
| *Text Export*   | **Python, DBBrowser for SQLite.** Export and upload .csv. | **Python, DBBrowser for SQLite.** *Unchanged from Iteration One.*  | TBD |
| *Data Analysis*   | **SQLite.** Basic queries. | **SQLite.** Variance analysis. | TBD |
| *Data Visualization*   | **LibreOffice's Calc Spreadsheet.** Display results. | **Microsoft Excel.** Display results with sparklines. | TBD |
